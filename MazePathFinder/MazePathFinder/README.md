# MazePathFinder
 
MazePathFinder is a maze game, but the playing is done by an algorithm. The algorithm is Breadth First Search or BFS. In the application, a user is given a maze and enters two coordinates of the maze, a start and end coordinate. The two coordinates are then passed to the BFS solver, which finds the shortest path from the start to end. BFS always guarantees the shortest path as long as one exists.

Each coordinate in the graph is considered a node and with each node are neighbors. Before BFS can run, a node direct adjacency list is made and printed for the user as well as the graph for user visual. 

All code is documented for users understanding.
